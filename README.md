### 2. [Control Flow](./controlFLow.py)
- **`if` and `else`**: Using `if` to check conditions and `else` to define alternate actions, such as checking if a number is even or odd.
- **`elif` Ladder**: Using multiple `elif` conditions to handle multiple choices, like checking the day of the week for different actions.
- **Loops**: Understanding `while` and `for` loops for repetitive tasks, along with control flow statements like `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.

---
### 3. [Data Structures](./Data%20Structure)
- **Introduction to Data Structures**: Covering the basics of various data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and more.
  
#### 3.1. [List Operations](./Data%20Structure/listdemo.py)
- **Defining and Iterating through Lists**: Creating a list and iterating through it using a `for` loop to access each element.
- **Accessing and Modifying Lists**: Accessing values using indexes and modifying specific elements within the list.
- **List Built-in Functions**: Using list functions like `extend()`, `insert()`, `append()`, `pop()`, and `remove()` to manipulate list elements.
